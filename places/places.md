When complete, I expect this page to house a map of the small villages I have visited.
In addition these *places* should be augmented by at least a story and a photo or two.  
Considering that am using a **static** site generator, this looks like a good problem to have.

### To Start With...
<div id='map' style="width:100%; height:600px; border:1px solid black;">
Map Goes Here
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<!-- <p id='iconttribution' style="float:right; font-size:60%;"></p> -->
