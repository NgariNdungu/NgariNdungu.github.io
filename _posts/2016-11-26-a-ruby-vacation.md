I'll admit it, blogging isn't easy. Keeping a set writing schedule is continously
proving impossible. What with the *I don't feel like doing anything today* and
*what the hell did I do today?* During this long*ish* off I've been getting
ready to inherit a rails application. As always the sheer amount of things to
learn is overwhelming. So, what exactly have I been able to do?

#### The Ruby Programming Language
I can't exactly take on a rails application without knowing Ruby(or can I?).
The first bit of the challenge was to learn enough ruby to keep myself from
drowning in the deep waters of web development with rails. Where to start?

Turns out I was already well on my way, with a ready ruby development environment
setup while [building] this blog. While learning python I've come to realize
my near hopelessness in following programming exercises that don't really do
anything. My search revealed the excellent [ruby koans] which seemed designed
for exactly what I needed - a quick introduction to the concepts of the language.

I still don't really *get* ruby. The syntax always seems a little funky.
I have found myself adding python colons to show function definitions, lost in
the numerous operators and looking for `return` statements before `end` statements.
Its a lot to take in and right now my knowledge of python feels more like a liability.

#### Ruby on rails
From one mind warping thing to the next. The [rails] web framework makes no
apology for it's design principles. You only need to watch the [introduction]
video to be awed(if rails is your first MVC framework) or thrown into confusion.
I could complain about the unfairness of life, but who doesn't? So instead of
complaining, it was easy as `gem install rails` and [getting started with rails]
to get a simple blog running.

If there's one thing I can't complain about it is documentation. Both ruby and
rails have pretty comprehensive official online documentation and there is a
wealth of other guides. Guides I will definitely need in the coming weeks.

#### Next steps
I have an app waiting for me, that I need to read and disect. I will need to
deploy this app and add functionality to it. I guess this is what excites me.
Will it sink or swim? Swim, obviously!
