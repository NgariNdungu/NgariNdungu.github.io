I think I understand a little of why the calendar is important. I can sort
of grasp the difficulty of life without the concept of quantifiable passage of
time. Each of us comes into this world on a certain day. A day which most of us
learn to hold special because those around us embrace it as an occasion to
celebrate. On this birth*day*, my age counter increases by 1. How much sense
this makes is debatable. I've never woken up the next day and felt the extra
year.

In the same vein, on the 31st day of the 12th month of every year, most of the
world welcomes a new year. A new year in which we seek a break from the past, a
new beginning. We dream of better things for the next 365/6 days and most of
the time we try to do something about it. Some of us make resolutions and stick
to them. Many more draw up the plans as they go. And the rest just stumble into
the new year without ever breaking stride.

This post was meant for a different time, but it never got finished. Stuff happens, and words fail. Hell, I'd have been impressed if I had held this idea for so long.
So I will leave it hanging, and believe that whatever I thought, you have thought yourself. After all, there's nothing new under the sun!
