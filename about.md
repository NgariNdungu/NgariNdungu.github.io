This is where am supposed to write something about myself. I am supposed to say how **awesome** I am and the **wonderful** things I do. So, here goes ...

I wear two hats when it comes to work. First, I'm the *tech guy*. I am a web developer, with Ruby on Rails and Django my preferred tools of the trade.
I also find myself consulting on implementation problems outside this domain. Besides being the tech guy, I am a *surveyor*. Yep, a land surveyor.
And I happen to enjoy wearing both of these hats.

There are things I am good at, and plenty more that am completely ignorant about. When not working I will be trying to reduce my ignorance by learning something new.

If you have a problem needing an extra perspective, or an interesting project, drop me a line on [twitter], or via [email].
